      <h2 class="h2style">What’s covered in these terms</h2>

      <h3 class="h3style">
        We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important
        to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google
        <a class="YfaGG" href="terms?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1#footnote-services"
          >services</a
        >, and what we expect from you.
      </h3>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service reflect
        <a
          href="https://about.google/intl/en-GB_SA/how-our-business-works"
          class="N6CPUe"
          target="_blank"
          >the way that Google’s business works</a
        >, the laws that apply to our company, and
        <a
          href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_GB"
          class="N6CPUe"
          target="_blank"
          >certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</a
        >. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship
        with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms
        include the following topic headings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="terms?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1#toc-what-you-expect"
            >What you can expect from us</a
          >, which describes how we provide and develop our services
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="terms?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1#toc-what-we-expect"
            >What we expect from you</a
          >, which establishes certain rules for using our services
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="terms?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1#toc-content"
            >Content in Google services</a
          >, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content
          that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you,
          Google or others
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="terms?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1#toc-problems"
            >In case of problems or disagreements</a
          >, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to
          expect in case someone violates these terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services,
        you’re agreeing to these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides these terms, we also publish a
        <a href="privacy?hl=en-SA&amp;fg=1">Privacy Policy</a>. Although it’s
        not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better
        understand how you can

        activity on the services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in
        their
