            <h3>
              We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important
              to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google
              <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#footnote-services">services</a>, and what we expect from you.
            </h3>
      
            <p>
              These Terms of Service reflect
              <a href="https://about.google/intl/en-GB_SA/how-our-business-works" target="_blank">
                the way that Google’s business works</a>, the laws that apply to our company, and
              <a href="https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_GB"
                target="_blank">certain things that we’ve always believed to be true</a>. 
                As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship
              with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms
              include the following topic headings:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin: revert;margin-left: 44px;">
                <li>

                  <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-what-we-expect">What we expect from you</a>, which establishes certain rules for using our services

                  <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-content">Content in Google services</a>, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content
                  that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you,
                  Google or others
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://www.google.com/terms?hl=en-SA&fg=1#toc-problems">In case of problems or disagreements</a>, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to
                  expect in case someone violates these terms.
                </li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services,
              you’re agreeing to these terms.

              Besides these terms, we also publish a
              <a href="https://www.google.com/privacy?hl=en-SA&fg=1">Privacy Policy</a>. Although it’s
              not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better
              understand how you can
